# 📊 Lumberjack Balancing
Lumberjack Balancing is a Python-based desktop application developed for Northern Arizona University (NAU) to automate and simplify the faculty workload calculation process. It enables associate deans to efficiently allocate teaching loads in accordance with institutional policies—minimizing errors, saving time, and increasing transparency.

# 🎯 Project Overview
Associate deans at NAU previously handled faculty workload calculations manually, which was time-consuming and error-prone. Lumberjack Balancing solves this by automating the process through an intuitive interface and dynamic backend algorithm, powered by data extracted from Excel spreadsheets.

# Key Features
- 📥 Excel-Based Data Input – Import faculty data directly from NAU’s existing Excel files.

- ⚖️ Dynamic Workload Calculation – Automatically computes workloads based on customizable policy tables.

- ✅ Real-Time Data Validation – Minimizes errors with built-in input checking.

- 📈 Comprehensive Reports – Export clear and actionable reports for administrators.

- 🖥️ User-Friendly Interface – Designed with non-technical users in mind using a minimalistic Tkinter GUI.

- 🔐 Client-Side Security – No data leaves the user’s machine.

# 🛠️ Built With
- Python – Core logic and data handling

- pandas & openpyxl – Excel file parsing and manipulation

PyQt6  – Graphical user interface (GUI)

unittest & pytest – Unit and integration testing

# 🧪 Testing Strategy
Unit Testing – Validates individual calculation and parsing components.

Integration Testing – Ensures seamless data flow between modules.

Usability Testing – Verified with real user feedback, including NAU associate deans.

Acceptance Testing – Final confirmation from project sponsor before deployment.
